## Project 1 - Weisfeiler-Lehman Algorithm to test for isomorphism.
Test if two graphs are isomorphic in polynomial time with no false negatives, but with false positives. The Weisfeiler-Lehman Algorithm labels the graph nodes consistently based on its proprieties. If both graphs have the same number of each labeled vertex, they could be isomorphic. Otherwise, they definitely are non-isomorphic.
